**Toggle Button and Bootstrap 4 CSS and ToggleButton.CSS**

![](media/89cdbd13378bbd48d04fa67b77e2cced.gif)

This is an update of the initial blog which now built using bootstrap 4â€™s
**bootstrapmin.css**. Originally I required a toggle button that would show /
Hide detail on activating a button without the use of using JavaScript code. The
result is a lightweight purely CSS driven project.

Please visit **Bayesean Blog** which explains the usage and code in greater
detail.
